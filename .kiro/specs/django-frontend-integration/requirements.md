# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to completely migrate the existing React frontend from any previous backend dependencies to the new Django backend that has already been implemented. This includes removing all traces of the previous Node.js/Express backend, cleaning up any related configuration, and fully integrating with the Django backend APIs for authentication, portfolio content management, e-commerce, and learning platform functionality. The frontend will be updated to consume Django APIs exclusively while maintaining the existing UI/UX design.

## Requirements
