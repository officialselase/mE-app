# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The React frontend's OfflineDetector component is attempting to check Django backend connectivity via a `/api/health/` endpoint that doesn't exist, causing 404 errors. Additionally, we need to ensure all frontend components that interact with Django API endpoints are properly connected and handle errors gracefully. This feature will implement a comprehensive health check system and verify all frontend-backend endpoint integrations are working correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to check if the Django backend is available and responding, so that I can provide accurate connectivity status to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes a GET request to `/api/health/` THEN the Django backend SHALL respond with a 200 status code
2. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response indicating the service status
3. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the response SHALL include a timestamp of the check
4. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the response SHALL complete within 2 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the health endpoint to provide basic system information, so that I can monitor the backend service status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return the application version or build information
2. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return the current server timestamp
3. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return a status field indicating "healthy"
4. IF the database is accessible THEN the system SHALL include database connectivity status in the response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the health endpoint to be lightweight and not require authentication, so that it can be used for monitoring without impacting performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL NOT require authentication
2. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL NOT perform heavy database operations
3. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL respond in under 500ms under normal conditions
4. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL use minimal server resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want to see accurate connectivity status in the OfflineDetector, so that I understand when features may not work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Django backend is available THEN the OfflineDetector SHALL show "Connected to Django API"
2. WHEN the Django backend is unavailable THEN the OfflineDetector SHALL show appropriate offline messaging
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the OfflineDetector SHALL automatically update the status
4. WHEN there are connection issues THEN the user SHALL have the option to retry the connection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify all frontend components are properly connected to their corresponding Django API endpoints, so that I can identify and fix any integration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication system is used THEN the frontend SHALL successfully connect to `/api/auth/` endpoints
2. WHEN the portfolio data is loaded THEN the frontend SHALL successfully connect to `/api/portfolio/` endpoints
3. WHEN the shop functionality is used THEN the frontend SHALL successfully connect to `/api/shop/` endpoints
4. WHEN the learning platform is accessed THEN the frontend SHALL successfully connect to `/api/learn/` endpoints
5. WHEN any API endpoint fails THEN the frontend SHALL handle the error gracefully with appropriate user messaging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want all frontend features to work seamlessly with the backend, so that I have a consistent experience across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to any page THEN all data loading SHALL work without 404 errors
2. WHEN I submit forms THEN the data SHALL be properly sent to and processed by the Django backend
3. WHEN there are API errors THEN I SHALL see helpful error messages instead of console errors
4. WHEN the backend is temporarily unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and show appropriate messaging
