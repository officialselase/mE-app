# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Django API client code in `src/utils/djangoApi.js` has critical JavaScript initialization errors that prevent the application from running properly. The `withGracefulDegradation` function is being used before it's declared, causing a "Cannot access 'withGracefulDegradation' before initialization" error. This feature will fix these code quality issues, improve the API client structure, and ensure all JavaScript follows proper initialization patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Function Declaration Order

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JavaScript functions to be properly declared before they are used, so that the application runs without initialization errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the djangoApi.js file is loaded THEN all functions SHALL be declared before they are used
2. WHEN `withGracefulDegradation` is referenced THEN it SHALL already be defined in the module scope
3. WHEN the module is imported THEN no "Cannot access before initialization" errors SHALL occur
4. WHEN functions are reorganized THEN the existing API functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 2: Improve Code Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Django API client code to be well-organized and maintainable, so that future modifications are easier to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are defined THEN they SHALL be placed at the top of the file before their usage
2. WHEN API methods are defined THEN they SHALL be grouped logically by functionality
3. WHEN helper functions are created THEN they SHALL have clear, descriptive names
4. WHEN the code is structured THEN it SHALL follow consistent patterns throughout

### Requirement 3: Maintain API Functionality

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want all existing API functionality to continue working after the code fixes, so that no features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL work exactly as before the refactoring
2. WHEN authentication is used THEN token handling SHALL continue to function properly
3. WHEN error handling is triggered THEN graceful degradation SHALL still work
4. WHEN retry logic is needed THEN it SHALL continue to operate as expected
5. WHEN deduplication is applied THEN it SHALL still prevent duplicate requests

### Requirement 4: Enhance Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and logging, so that debugging API issues is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and logged appropriately
2. WHEN function initialization fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the error context SHALL include relevant debugging information
4. WHEN graceful degradation is used THEN the fallback reason SHALL be logged

### Requirement 5: Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Django API client to follow JavaScript best practices, so that the code is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are declared THEN they SHALL use consistent declaration patterns (function declarations vs expressions)
2. WHEN variables are used THEN they SHALL be properly scoped and initialized
3. WHEN imports and exports are used THEN they SHALL be organized and clearly defined
4. WHEN the code is linted THEN it SHALL pass all ESLint rules without errors

### Requirement 6: Preserve Existing Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want all current Django API features to remain available after the code fixes, so that no functionality is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication APIs are called THEN login, register, and token refresh SHALL work
2. WHEN portfolio APIs are called THEN projects, thoughts, and work experience SHALL load
3. WHEN learn APIs are called THEN courses, lessons, and submissions SHALL function
4. WHEN shop APIs are called THEN products and cart operations SHALL work
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN connectivity testing SHALL operate correctly

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the fixed code works correctly, so that no regressions are introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fixed code is loaded THEN no JavaScript initialization errors SHALL occur
2. WHEN API methods are called THEN they SHALL return expected results
3. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN graceful degradation SHALL work properly
4. WHEN the application starts THEN all Django API functionality SHALL be available
