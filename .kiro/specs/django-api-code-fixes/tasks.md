# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix function declaration order in djangoApi.js





  - Move `withGracefulDegradation` function to top of file after imports and before its first usage
  - Move `handleDjangoError` function to utility section near `withGracefulDegradation`
  - Ensure all utility functions are declared before API method definitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_
-

- [x] 2. Reorganize code structure for better maintainability




  - Add clear section comments to organize different parts of the file
  - Group related functions together (utilities, factories, API methods)
  - Ensure consistent function declaration patterns throughout the file
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
-

- [x] 3. Validate and test the fixed code



  - Test that the module loads without initialization errors
  - Verify all existing API functionality still works correctly
  - Confirm graceful degradation and retry logic operate as expected
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 3.1 Write unit tests for reorganized functions







  - Create tests for `withGracefulDegradation` function behavior
  - Write tests for `handleDjangoError` function with various error types
  - Test API factory functions work correctly after reorganization
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_
-

- [ ] 4. Improve error handling and logging


  - Add initialization success logging to verify proper module loading
  - Enhance error context in API failure scenarios
  - Ensure all JavaScript errors are properly caught and logged
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Ensure code quality standards compliance



  - Run ESLint on the reorganized code and fix any issues
  - Standardize variable declarations and function patterns
  - Organize imports and exports for clarity
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
