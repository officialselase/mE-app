# Content Management API Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete content management backend API for managing projects, thoughts (blog posts), and work experience entries.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Task 4.1) ✅

Created three migration files for SQLite database:

#### `002_create_projects_table.sql`
- Projects table with fields: id, title, description, long_description, images (JSON), technologies (JSON), github_url, live_url, featured, timestamps
- Indexes on featured and created_at for efficient querying
- Auto-updating timestamp trigger

#### `003_create_thoughts_table.sql`
- Thoughts table with fields: id, title, snippet, content, date, featured, tags (JSON), timestamps
- Indexes on featured, date, and created_at
- Auto-updating timestamp trigger

#### `004_create_work_experience_table.sql`
- Work experience table with fields: id, company, position, description, start_date, end_date, current, technologies (JSON), display_order, timestamps
- Indexes on display_order and start_date
- Auto-updating timestamp trigger

All migrations executed successfully and tables created in the database.

### 2. Projects API Endpoints (Task 4.2) ✅

**Controller:** `backend/controllers/projectsController.js`
**Routes:** `backend/routes/projectsRoutes.js`

Implemented endpoints:
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects with pagination and featured filter
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get single project
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project (admin only)
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project (admin only)

Features:
- Pagination support (page, limit query params)
- Featured content filtering
- JSON field parsing (images, technologies)
- Proper validation and error handling
- Admin-only write operations

### 3. Thoughts API Endpoints (Task 4.3) ✅

**Controller:** `backend/controllers/thoughtsController.js`
**Routes:** `backend/routes/thoughtsRoutes.js`

Implemented endpoints:
- `GET /api/thoughts` - List all thoughts with pagination and featured filter
- `GET /api/thoughts/:id` - Get single thought
- `POST /api/thoughts` - Create thought (admin only)
- `PUT /api/thoughts/:id` - Update thought (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/thoughts/:id` - Delete thought (admin only)

Features:
- Pagination support
- Featured content filtering
- JSON field parsing (tags)
- Date-based sorting (most recent first)
- Admin-only write operations

### 4. Work Experience API Endpoints (Task 4.4) ✅

**Controller:** `backend/controllers/workController.js`
**Routes:** `backend/routes/workRoutes.js`

Implemented endpoints:
- `GET /api/work` - List all work experience entries
- `GET /api/work/:id` - Get single work experience entry
- `POST /api/work` - Create work experience (admin only)
- `PUT /api/work/:id` - Update work experience (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/work/:id` - Delete work experience (admin only)

Features:
- Sorted by start_date (most recent first) and display_order
- JSON field parsing (technologies)
- Current position flag support
- Admin-only write operations

## Technical Details

### Database
- **Type:** SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Location:** `backend/data/portfolio.db`
- **Features:** Foreign keys enabled, WAL mode for concurrency

### Authentication & Authorization
- Public read access for all GET endpoints
- Admin-only access for POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- JWT token authentication via `authenticateToken` middleware
- Role-based access control via `requireAdmin` middleware

### Data Format
- Arrays stored as JSON strings in database
- Automatically parsed to arrays in API responses
- Boolean fields (featured, current) stored as integers (0/1), returned as booleans

### Error Handling
- Validation errors return 400 with field-specific messages
- Not found errors return 404
- Authentication errors return 401
- Authorization errors return 403
- All errors handled by global error handler

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `backend/migrations/002_create_projects_table.sql`
2. `backend/migrations/003_create_thoughts_table.sql`
3. `backend/migrations/004_create_work_experience_table.sql`
4. `backend/controllers/projectsController.js`
5. `backend/controllers/thoughtsController.js`
6. `backend/controllers/workController.js`
7. `backend/routes/projectsRoutes.js`
8. `backend/routes/thoughtsRoutes.js`
9. `backend/routes/workRoutes.js`
10. `backend/test-content-api.ps1`
11. `backend/docs/CONTENT_API.md`

### Modified Files
1. `backend/server.js` - Added routes for projects, thoughts, and work

## Testing

### Test Script
Created `test-content-api.ps1` for quick API testing:
```powershell
.\backend\test-content-api.ps1
```

Tests all public GET endpoints for:
- Projects (all and featured)
- Thoughts (all and featured)
- Work experience

### Manual Testing
For admin endpoints, use tools like:
- Postman
- Thunder Client (VS Code extension)
- curl commands

Example:
```bash
# Get all projects
curl http://localhost:5000/api/projects

# Create project (requires admin token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","description":"Test project"}'
```

## Next Steps

The content management API is now ready for:
1. Frontend integration (Task 5)
2. Seeding with initial data
3. Optional unit tests (Task 4.5 - marked as optional)

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ Requirement 15.1 - Projects API with pagination and featured filter
✅ Requirement 15.2 - Work experience API
✅ Requirement 15.3 - Thoughts API with pagination and featured filter
✅ Requirement 15.8 - Content creation via API
✅ Requirement 15.9 - Content updates via API
✅ Requirement 15.10 - Content deletion via API

## Notes

- All endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Consistent response format across all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Admin authentication required for write operations
- Public read access for all content
- Pagination implemented for scalability
- Featured content filtering for homepage display
